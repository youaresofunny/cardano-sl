-- | Given the coin selection result from a policy run, adjust the outputs
-- for fees, potentially returning additional inputs that we need to cover
-- all fees.
-- We lose the relationship between the transaction outputs and their
-- corresponding inputs/change outputs here. This is a decision we
-- may wish to revisit later. For now however note that since
--
--      (a) coin selection tries to establish a particular ratio
--          between payment outputs and change outputs (currently it
--          aims for an average of 1:1)
--
--      (b) coin selection currently only generates a single change
--          output per payment output, distributing the fee
--          proportionally across all change outputs is roughly
--          equivalent to distributing it proportionally over the
--          payment outputs (roughly, not exactly, because the 1:1
--          proportion is best effort only, and may in some cases be
--          wildly different).
--
-- Note that for (a) we don't need the ratio to be 1:1, the above
-- reasoning will remain true for any proportion 1:n. For (b) however,
-- if coin selection starts creating multiple outputs, and this number
-- may vary, then losing the connection between outputs and change
-- outputs will mean that that some outputs may pay a larger
-- percentage of the fee (depending on how many change outputs the
-- algorithm happened to choose).
